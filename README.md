# To-do List

This is a simple project to mark the beginning of my web development journey. It's a practice project utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a basic to-do list application. Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed by clicking on them.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistence**: Tasks are stored locally, so they persist even after the browser is closed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: For creating the structure of the web page.
- CSS: For styling the elements and making the interface visually appealing.
- JavaScript: For implementing the functionality of the to-do list.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

- **Adding a Task**: Type the task in the input field and press Enter or click on the "Add" button.
- **Marking as Completed**: Click on a task to mark it as completed. Click again to unmark.
- **Deleting a Task**: Click on the delete button (usually represented by a 'X' icon) next to the task you want to remove.
